Shareable Repository for the Altair Tutorial for Assignment 2 of SIADS 521 for the University of Michigan MADS Program, Fall 2019.

The objective of this assignment is to construct a tutorial on a visualization technique that was either not covered in class, 
or covered but using a different toolkit. 
The idea is to describe the technique, comment about its use, background and limitations as well as performing a basic demonstration of it.
